Solution to class Lab 13 C, an exception handling lab

Ask the user to enter a byte value.  Use Scanner's nextByte method to read the byte and store it in a byte primitive. If the byte is odd, tell them it is odd.  If the byte is even, tell them it is even. If they enter a word or a non-byte, tell them that's not a byte.
